# Telegram CopyBot Backend ðŸ¤–ðŸ”™

Telegram CopyBot Backend is the back-end part of a service designed to manage a web application for copying content from one Telegram channel to another. It handles the logic and functionality required for copying content efficiently and reliably.

## Features

- **Telegram API Integration:** Utilize the Telegram Bot API to interact with Telegram channels and perform copying tasks.
- **Message Parsing:** Parse incoming messages from source channels and prepare them for copying to destination channels.
- **Content Filtering:** Implement filters to specify which types of content should be copied (e.g., messages, images, videos).
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors and exceptions gracefully to ensure smooth operation of the copying process.
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Set up scheduled tasks to automate the copying process at specific times or intervals.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- FastAPI (pthon Web Framework for building API for this service)
- Telethon (Telegram Bot API library)
- Database (e.g., SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL) for storing configuration and scheduling information
- Task scheduling library (e.g., APScheduler) for managing scheduled tasks
